## My process

### Built with
- JS DOM
- JS Functions
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript DOM Manipulation, flexboxes, media queries, html elements and many more.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media only screen and (min-width: 790px) {
}
```
```js
        if(e.which ==13 || e.keyCode == 13) {
            localStorage.setItem("names", e.target.innerText);
            names.blur();
        }else {
            localStorage.setItem("names", e.target.innerText);
        }
}
```


### Continued development

I will build backend and extra pages for this website in the future.
